This project aims to empower stakeholders, including policymakers, healthcare professionals, researchers, and the general public, with actionable insights to navigate through the pandemic effectively. 

Excited to share my latest project on COVID-19 data analysis using Tableau as part of a continuous assignment for my course!



In continuation of my coursework, I embarked on a personal project to delve into the multifaceted aspects of COVID-19 in India. Leveraging data science techniques and Tableau's powerful visualization tools, I aimed to gain insights into the impact of the virus and contribute to our understanding of the crisis.



üë®‚Äçüíª Project Overview:

I analyzed various facets of the pandemic, including case counts, mortality rates, vaccination coverage, demographic patterns, and testing infrastructure. Using publicly available datasets from Kaggle, I developed an interactive dashboard that offers dynamic visualizations to facilitate data-driven decision-making.



üåê Key Features:

- Interactive Visualizations: Explore COVID-19 data dynamically, drilling down into specific regions, time periods, and demographic categories.

- Geospatial Mapping: Visualize the geographical distribution of cases, deaths, vaccination rates, and testing facilities across Indian states.

- Temporal Trends Analysis: Track the progression of the pandemic and assess the effectiveness of public health interventions over time.

- Demographic Insights: Highlight demographic patterns of COVID-19 impacts to aid in targeted resource allocation and intervention planning.

- Testing Infrastructure Assessment: Evaluate the distribution and performance of COVID-19 testing labs across different states.

- Vaccination Monitoring: Monitor vaccination coverage and progress across Indian states.



üìà Impact:

This project aims to empower stakeholders, including policymakers, healthcare professionals, researchers, and the general public, with actionable insights to navigate through the pandemic effectively. By fostering collaboration and innovation, we can work towards mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on public health and society.
